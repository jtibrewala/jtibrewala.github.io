## SEO Contd - Finding the right keywords
- Build customer Personas
- Go to where they hang out online and find out what they discuss.
- Look at long tail keywords in the search bar + long tail keywords at bottom on page 1 of your search results + Quora
- Research keyword volume at semrush.com and https://kwfinder.com/
- Examine growth of keywords in google trends

- Source: https://neilpatel.com/blog/right-keywords-seo/
- Start with Ubersuggest - https://neilpatel.com/ubersuggest/
- What you’ll want to look for are keywords that have high paid difficulty, which means the keyword is so valuable that a lot of people are competing for the paid ad spots.
- In addition to looking at the paid difficulty number, you’ll want to find keywords that have a low SEO difficulty score.
- You need to focus on the regions where the majority of your PAID customer base is.
- Use a tool like “SimilarWeb” to find competitors https://www.similarweb.com/website/clearfunds.com
- Take the competing URLs, put them back in Ubersuggest and look at top pages report and examine every keyword that takes them to top pages report
- With the combination of the top pages and keywords report, you should have a list of great keywords to go after.
- Review other links provided at Source
- First focus on keywords that drive direct sales and then go after the keywords that would grow my brand.
