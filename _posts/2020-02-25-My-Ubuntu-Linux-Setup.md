# My current Linux Setup for 2020

In this post, I'd like to share the setup and software of my personal laptop, powered by Linux. This article is inspired by [this post](https://dev.to/brpaz/my-linux-development-environment-of-2018-ch7). This also serves as a repository for future setups and changes that I may do. 

I've been programming in *nix based environments since 1995. My introduction with Linux happened in approx 1997, and from being a casual user to a daily user, inspite of being part of several Windows-only corporate environments, have managed to stay informed, and now run this 24x7 on my personal laptop.  I no longer do any software development, nor write any code, but still prefer linux over others. 

I won't list all the applications I have installed on the machine, but only the ones I consider relevant and more focused on a kick-ass laptop environment.

## Base system
- Kubuntu
